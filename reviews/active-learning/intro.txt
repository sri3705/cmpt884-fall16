1. algos for learning with queries.
2. distill core ideas, methods, and applications that have been considered by ML community.
3. Active learning - query learning - optimal experiment design
4. curious learning algo - avoiding hundreds of labeled instances.
5. getting labels might be hard / expensive
e.g. speech recognition (much longer labeling time), information extraction (domain knowledge),
classification (thousands of instance labels).

active learning - few labeled instances as possible - minimizing cost of obtaining data.
instructional techniques in educational literature.

several strategies/scenarios in which active learners may pose queries - pool based active learning
(selection from large unlabeled pool), using uncertainity sampling - two examples presented here.

e.g. logistic regression - pool based active learning > random labeling of samples (iid sampling)
e.g. text classification - pool based active learning > random labeling of samples
