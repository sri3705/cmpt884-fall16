hierarchical structure
scale: 3.2M annotated - 5247 categories
hierarchy: dense semantic heirarchy - ontology (many categories per subtree)
diversity: appearances, positions, view points, poses, bg clutter
diversity measured using average image (more blur - more diversity)
small image datasets < imagenet - nextgen algo
tinyimage dataset -> high noise and low resolution images
ESP -> basic level of semantic hierarchy, dependence on disambiguation, not available to public
labelme -> outlines provided (not there in Imagenet), not used from internet.
