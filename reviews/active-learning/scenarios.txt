1. Membership query synthesis
queries generated by learner in a query de novo fashion. Tractable for finite problem domains. Used in regression type problems. Problem: sometimes, such queries might not make sense for humans. However, could be applied when automatic annotators are involved in the labeling process.
 
2. stream-based selective sampling
Assumption: unlabeled datapoint is inexpensive to obtain. Each unlabeled instance is randomly sampled and learner decides whether to query this sample. One way is by using informative measure and make biased random decision such that more informative instances shd be queried. Another approach is to compute explicit region of uncertainity. Naive way is to do minimum thresholding on informative measure. Another method is to define region unknown to the overall model class by finding set of instances that have different labels returned by two models of the same model class. It has been used in several applications where size of ds nearest neighbor algo is drastically reduced.

3. pool-based sampling
Large pool of unlabeled samples exist. Instances are queried in greedy fashion. former scans thru data sequentially and makes individual query decisions, where s here it finds best query. Former is more applicable under limited memory.
