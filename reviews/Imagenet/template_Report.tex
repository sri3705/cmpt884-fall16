\maketitle

This paper introduces ImageNet, a large-scale, diverse, hierarchical image database as a need for benchmarking robust models, and aiding several critical computer vision tasks, 
such as Object Recognition, Image Classification and object localization. It uses wordnet as a backbone, and provides dense
tree-structured subcategories. Imagenet also boasts to contain unprecedented number of examples per category, categories,
non-overlapping categories.
\par
To construct the database, the authors first collect vast unclean data from across different search engines, using multiple
languages, and appending parent words given the class. They clean the dataset using Amazon Mechanical turk by
asking multiple workers to verify if a given image contains the given object of interest regardless of the artifacts like occlusion,
multiple objects ,to name a few. Each image is considered a positive sample if it satisfies a confidence score that is determined
dynamically, representing semantic difficulty for that category.
\par
The authors show three appplications of Imagenet. The first experiment involving object recognition emphasized importance
of having a high resolution large clean dataset through demonstration of improved performance using nearest neighbor approach
compared to noisy, low resolution, limited example settings. The second experiment involving image classification lays its
focus on importance of dense hierarchical structure of Imagenet and highlighted its importance by showing superior performance
of classifier that incorporates semantic tree relationship, over a shallow independent classifier. The third
