\maketitle

This paper introduces ImageNet, a large-scale, diverse, hierarchical image database as a need for benchmarking robust models, and aiding several critical computer vision tasks, 
such as Object Recognition, Image Classification and Object Localization. It uses wordnet as a backbone, and provides dense
tree-structured subcategories. Imagenet also boasts to contain unprecedented number of examples per category, categories,
non-overlapping categories.
\par
To construct the database, the authors first collect vast unclean data from across different search engines, using multiple
languages, and appending parent words given the class. They clean the dataset using Amazon Mechanical turk by
asking multiple workers to label a given image contains the given object of interest, combining it through a consensus
mechanism that modeled semantic difficulty for its category.
\par
Towards the end, authors show three appplications of Imagenet. The first application involving  object recognition emphasized importance
of having a high resolution large clean dataset. The second application involved image classification setting its focus on importance of dense 
hierarchical structure. The third application involved object localization, demonstrated Imagenet's 
prospects to be used in benchmarking object detection algorithms.
\par
In summary, the work provides significant contribution to computer vision research community, with large-scale diverse
clean dataset, with unprecedented set of object categories related by dense hierarchies. The authors clearly demonstrate
the effectiveness of having such a dataset through appropriate applications. The comparisons with previous related work
are very pertinent too.
