    "In addition to *interactivity*, another main reason that people love to use jupyter for data analysis is *reproducibility*. That is, when seeing a data analysis result in a shared notebook (e.g., [gun violence analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/minrk/4358066/Gun%20Data.ipynb)), you do not only see the analysis result but also the code that produces the result. Moreover, you can further examine the result by rerunning or extending the code.\n",

    "However, if your notebook involves crowdsourced data processing, it will be not easy to share the code or allow others to examine the result. More specifically, consider the following two situations and think about what would happen to the above image-labeling notebook. \n",

    "1. **[Sharable]**. What if you want to share the code with your friend such that your friend can rerun your code and get the same result as you? \n",

    "Now, let's be real and start implementing (maybe) your first ever crowdsourcing algorithm. Imagine you collect a number of pictures of the SFU campus, but have a hard time in chooing the most beautiful one. You decide to leverage the wisdom of the crowd to solve the problem. This is essentially a crowdsourced Max operation. There are various algorithms proposed in the literature (See Sec 7.5.1 in this [survey](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jnwang/papers/tkde16-crowdsurvey.pdf)). <font color='red'>In this assignment, your job is to implement the tournament max algorithm using reprowd.</font>  \n",

    "- **[Algorithm Description].** The tournament max algorithm, as the name suggested, is a tournament-like algorithm that is widely used in sports for choosing the best team. Suppose there are n items. It first generates n/2 pairs, and asks the crowd to compare the two items in each pair. Then, it chooses the better one of each pair and generates n/4 new pairs. Iteratively, when there is only one item left, it will be considered as the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Example].** Suppose you have eight pictures, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The tournament max algorithm will first generate four tasks, i.e., (A, B), (C, D), (E, F), (G, H), where each task is a pair of pictures and it asks the crowd to choose the more beautiful one. Say A, C, E, G are the winners in each pair. It then generates another two tasks, i.e., (A, C), (E, G). Say A and E are the winners in each pair. Finally, it generates the last task, i.e., (A, E). The better picture between A and E will be returned as the most beautiful picture. \n",
